Created the set, nb elem : 0
Pushed [1,3,2], nb elem : 3
Print GSet:
2, 3, 1
Pop elements :
2, 3, 1, 
Push back and drop elements :
1, 3, 2, 
Append back and pop elements :
1, 3, 2, 
Append back and drop elements :
2, 3, 1, 
Add sort (decreasing) [2,3,1] and get elements :
3, 2, 1, 
Switch 1st and 3rd elements:
1, 2, 3, 
Insert 0 at 0, 2, 8 and get elements :
0, 1, 0, 2, 3, (null), (null), (null), 0, 
Split the set at 1:
0, 1, 0, 2 and 3, (null), (null), (null), 0
Merge back the set:
0, 1, 0, 2, 3, (null), (null), (null), 0
Clone the set and print it:
0, 1, 0, 2, 3, (null), (null), (null), 0
Sort the elements, before:
0.981,0.867,0.697,0.762,0.871,0.394,0.284,0.143,0.292,
Sort the elements, after:
